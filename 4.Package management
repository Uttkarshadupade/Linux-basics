Package management:-
      A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer 
programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner.

    dpkg is a low-level package manager for Debian-based systems. It can install, remove, provide informationabout and build *.deb packages but it canâ€™t automatically download
and install their corresponding dependencies.

    apt-get is a high-level package manager for Debian and derivatives, and provides a simple way to retrieve and install packages, including dependency resolution, 
from multiple sources using the command line.Unlike dpkg, apt-get does not work directly with *.deb files, but with the package proper name.

   aptitude is another high-level package manager for Debian-based systems, and can be used to perform management tasks (installing, upgrading, and removing
packages, also handling dependency resolutionautomatically) in a fast and easy way.

  rpm is the package management system used by Linux Standard Base (LSB)-compliant distributions for low-level handling of packages.

  yum adds the functionality of automatic updates and package management with dependency management to RPM-based systems.

Some of the commands used are: 
     1.To view the package details: yum info PACKAGENAME 
     2.Install a package:  yum install PACKAGENAME 
     3.Update all PAckage: yum update
     4.Remove a package: yum remove PACKAGENAME
     5.To view transaction history: yum remove PACKAGENAME
     6.To reverse a transaction: yum history undo INDEXNUMBER
